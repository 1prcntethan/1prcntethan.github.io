          is an isometric/static skill that involves holding your entire body
          horizontal to the ground while hanging from a bar. On this site, it’s
          rated A, for <strong>high intermediate</strong>, and takes around 1-2
          years to learn, given daily training. The front lever is a super
          impressive skill which requires immense pull strength and multiple
          progressions. By learning the front lever, you develop your
          <strong> back, triceps, and core muscles</strong>.

        <div className="guide-text">
          The front lever is a strength focused exercise which requires mainly
          back strength. As such, the{" "}
          <strong>primary mover for this skill is the lats</strong>, so the
          stronger your lats, the better off you are when you start this skill.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          The front lever also requires strength from other muscles too. The
          core is extremely important, in order to hold your legs in parallel
          with your torso. Additionally, your triceps must be strong to keep
          your arms straight and locked out while performing the skill. Finally,
          your scapula retraction strength must be strong enough to keep your
          scapula in a neutral position.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          Fortunately, we can work on these aspects of the front lever as we go
          through the progressions, so these “prerequisites” are not really
          prerequisites, but rather{" "}
          <strong>points to focus and strengthen</strong>. However, you should
          be confident in your pull-ups and rows – 10-15 pullups, and 20 rows.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          So, you want to learn the Front Lever. First, you should start with
          pull-ups, to train your lats. It’s worth mentioning here, if you have
          the option of weighted pull-ups, absolutely work on those. Weighted
          pull-ups are a <strong>cheat code</strong> for lat strength, and they
          transfer over really well to the front lever.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          Once you have decent pulling strength, the first progression you will
          start with is the{" "}
          <Link to="/tutorials/tuckfl" className="guide-external-link">
            Tuck Front Lever
          </Link>
          . It’s a pretty simple progression; focus on{" "}
          <strong>
            scapula retraction, keeping your arms straight, and maintaining a
            horizontal body
          </strong>
          . In this stage, you can use exercises like{" "}
          <Link to="/tutorials/scapulapullup" className="guide-external-link">
            Scapula Pull-ups
          </Link>{" "}
          and Regular{" "}
          <Link to="/tutorials/pullup" className="guide-external-link">
            Pull-ups

          to supplement.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          Your goal for the{" "}

            Tuck Front Lever
          </Link>{" "}
          is 15 seconds bare minimum, longer if you want to reach true mastery.
          Once you reach this mark, you can (probably) safely move on to the

            Adv. Tuck Front Lever
          </Link>
          . In this position, you will be slowly extending that lever arm, and
          the exercise will all of a sudden become extremely hard in comparison.
          That’s the progressive overload.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          The{" "}

          is not a real progression, but it is right in between the Tuck FL and
          the Adv. Tuck FL. Also, the{" "}
          <Link to="/tutorials/pikeflrow" className="guide-external-link">
            Pike FL Row
          </Link>{" "}
          is useful to start building the strength for FL Rows, which are hard
          to start in Adv. Tuck FL. But of course, these are optional, it’s up
          to you to use them or not.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          Once you’re in the{" "}

            Adv. Tuck FL
          </Link>
          , make sure to focus on the same form cues:{" "}
          <strong>straight arms, horizontal body, retracted scapula</strong>.
          You also might be starting to think about your pelvis position. For
          now, it doesn’t matter much, but try to open it. Essentially,{" "}
          <strong>flatten your lower back</strong>.
        </div>

        <div className="guide-text">
          You can practice this lying down on a flat ground. Literally lie down,
          and mess around with your pelvis tilt until your{" "}
          <strong>entire lower back is in contact with the ground</strong>. That
          is the position you want to try and imitate. You can take it a step
          further by feeling this lower back contact in the hollow body hold
          too.

          </Link>{" "}
          is the same, around 15 seconds. However, keep working on this hold so
          you have more experience holding it confidently for longer. Once you
          hit this amount, you can move onto the{" "}

            Super Adv. Tuck FL

          . Technically, this is not a real progression. But having this
          progression will{" "}
          <strong>
            make the transition from Adv. Tuck FL to Straddle much easier
          </strong>
          .
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          In this progression, you will focus on the same things as the last.
          However, some things you’ll notice: Your{" "}
          <strong>pelvis position will be much more open</strong>, and this is
          your chance to try to emphasize that open pelvis position. The other
          thing is that with a more open position, you will really feel the
          tension in your abs a lot more than the other progressions.{" "}
          <strong>This is completely normal</strong>.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          Now that the abs are finally being worked under a more stretched
          position, they likely aren’t used to this sort of exercise. This is
          where{" "}

            dragon flags
          </Link>
          , or the regressions, can be extremely useful. You’ll learn the{" "}
          <strong>open/neutral pelvis position</strong>, as well as strengthen
          your abs for this stretched position.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          At this stage, you probably have enough strength to start working on
          <Link to="/tutorials/advtuckflrow" className="guide-external-link">
            Adv. Tuck FL Rows
          </Link>
          . These will strengthen your mid-back and increase your pulling
          strength overall. They should feel great especially if you did decide
          to use the{" "}

          Disclaimer: you will likely spend the{" "}

          is particularly challenging. You have finally completely opened up
          your hips, and your abs are a definite part of the equation. In
          addition, the lever arm has gotten much longer, and the exercise is
          much harder.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          There’s really nothing to do besides to work on the skill. Train hard,

            Dragon Flags

          for the abs, <strong>emphasize retraction</strong>, get stronger.
          You’ll keep working on{" "}
          <strong>raises, negatives, and lengthening the hold time </strong>for
          <Link to="/tutorials/straddlefl" className="guide-external-link">
            Straddle FL
          </Link>
          . Again, your goal is 15 seconds, and you’ll soon find you have the
          strength to hold a{" "}
          <Link to="/tutorials/halflayfl" className="guide-external-link">
            Halflay FL
          </Link>
          . This is the closest progression to Full FL, and you’ll definitely
          feel it in your abs and your back. Train the same way, with{" "}
          <strong>negatives, holds and raises</strong>, and at some point,
          you’ll have the strength to do <strong>Full FL negatives</strong>.
          Soon, you’ll be able to do <strong>FL raises with momentum</strong>.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          Finally, with time, you will be able to hold the{" "}
          <Link to="/tutorials/fullfl" className="guide-external-link">
            Full Front Lever
          </Link>
          . The form cues are all the same, so that’s it! Front Lever unlocked.
          Increasing your full FL time will{" "}
          <strong>look the same as how you achieved it</strong>; just holds,
          negatives, and raises. Focus on using{" "}
          <Link to="/tutorials/halflayfl" className="guide-external-link">
            Halflay

          as your progressions, because it’s the closest to the real thing.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          If you’re having trouble transitioning from one progression to the
          next, consider using <strong>resistance bands</strong>. Use the
          resistance bands when holding your target progression. For example, if
          you can’t do Straddle FL, but you can do Super Adv. Tuck FL, just
          train the Straddle FL with a resistance band on. Make sure it’s at the
          <strong> waist level, in line with your center of gravity</strong>.
          Finally, start with a semi-light band, and over time switch to lighter
          and lighter bands. You’ll find that you won’t need a band at some
          point, and you’ll have unlocked the skill.
